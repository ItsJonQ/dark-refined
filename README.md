## Generate

This is the magic sauce for Refined's themes!

### Setup

This project only has a couple of dependencies, which it uses to generate the VS Code `theme.json` files.

To install the dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

To build the theme file(s), run:

```
npm start
```

### Theme files

A theme only really requires a single shade, which makes up the background.

**Example**

```js
// themes/palenight.js
const colors = require('../colors/default')

const config = {
  name: 'Dark (Palenight)',
  type: 'dark',
}

const shades = {
  background: '#292d3e',
}

module.exports = {
  config,
  shades,
  colors,
}
```

The theme is generated into `/themes/`, with it's details added to `package.json` - ready for publishing!
